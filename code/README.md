## 01_code_model: Code used for simulating our model 


How to make use of source code:

 - The asterisk (*) in the following filenames should be replaced by the abbreviations of the three models: 'nasch' or 'nasch_p' (standard Nagel-Schreckenberg), 'fsl' (Flexible Speed Limits modification) and 'acc' (Adaptive Cruise Control modification).

- Parameters for the main simulations are generated with script 'par.m'.

- The main simulations are run and the results are stored with scripts 'main_*.m'. The results are plotted with the scripts 'plot_results_*.m'. 

- The velocity distributions are measured using the scripts 'vDist_*.m' and plotted with the script 'plot_vDist.m'.

- A visualisation of all states generated by a simulation can be obtained by using the functions 'plot_*'.






## 02_code_animation: Code used for animations

- running the '*_simulation.m' files will generate one of the three movies
- 'colorbar.m' is used to color the bar plot
- 'draw_car.m' is used to draw and color the cars (original version downloaded from course website and then modified)
