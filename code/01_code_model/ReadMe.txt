How to make use of source code:

The asterisk (*) in the following filenames should be replaced by the abbreviations of the three models: 'nasch' or 'nasch_p' (standard Nagel-Schreckenberg), 'fsl' (Flexible Speed Limits modification) and 'acc' (Adaptive Cruise Control modification).

Parameters for the main simulations are generated with script 'par.m'.

The main simulations are run and the results are stored with scripts 'main_*.m'. The results are plotted with the scripts 'plot_results_*.m'. 

The velocity distributions are measured using the scripts 'vDist_*.m' and plotted with the script 'plot_vDist.m'.

A visualisation of all states generated by a simulation can be obtained by using the functions 'plot_*'.
